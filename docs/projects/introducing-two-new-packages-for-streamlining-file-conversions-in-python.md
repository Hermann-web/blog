# Introducing Two New Packages for Streamlining File Conversions in Python

In the realm of data processing and manipulation, efficient handling of file conversions is often a crucial requirement. Python, with its rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, provides powerful tools for tackling such tasks.

I've developed [two packages with the intention of offering a robust file conversion design pattern separated from specific implementation details](https://github.com/Hermann-web/file-converter). While many existing solutions focus on providing direct conversion implementations, these packages provide a structured approach that facilitates easy extension, customization, and integration into various projects.

In this blog post, we'll explore how to unlock the magic of data manipulation by streamlining file conversion operations using two powerful packages: [`openconv-core`](https://test.pypi.org/project/openconv-core/) and [`openconv-python`](https://test.pypi.org/project/openconv-python/).

## Introducing `openconv-core`

The [`openconv-core`](https://github.com/Hermann-web/file-converter/tree/main/openconv-core) package serves as a solid foundation for building robust file conversion utilities in Python. It offers a modular and extensible architecture designed to simplify the process of reading from and writing to various file formats. Let's delve into some of its key features:

### Modular Input/Output Handlers

The framework defines abstract base classes for file readers and writers, allowing for easy extension and customization. This modular approach ensures flexibility in handling different types of input and output files.

### Support for Various File Formats

With built-in support for common file formats such as text, CSV, JSON, XML, Excel, and image files, the framework caters to diverse conversion needs out of the box.

### MIME Type Detection

The inclusion of a MIME type guesser utility enables automatic detection of file MIME types based on content, facilitating seamless conversion operations.

### Exception Handling

Custom exceptions are implemented to handle errors related to unsupported file types, empty suffixes, file not found, and mismatches between file types, ensuring robust error management during conversions.

### Base Converter Class

The framework provides an abstract base class for implementing specific file converters, offering a standardized interface for conversion operations.

### Resolved Input File Representation

A class is introduced to represent input files with resolved file types, ensuring consistency and correctness in conversion tasks.

To start using `openconv-core`, you can install it using pip from the [Test PyPI repository](https://test.pypi.org/project/openconv-core/):

```bash
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ openconv-core
```

To illustrate the usage of `openconv-core`, let's consider an example of converting a CSV file to JSON:

```python
from openconv-core.io_handler import CSVReader, JSONWriter
from openconv-core.base_converter import BaseConverter, ResolvedInputFile
from openconv-core.filetypes import FileType

class CSVToJSONConverter(BaseConverter):
    file_reader = CSVReader()
    file_writer = JSONWriter()

    @classmethod
    def _get_supported_input_type(cls) -> FileType:
        return FileType.CSV

    @classmethod
    def _get_supported_output_type(cls) -> FileType:
        return FileType.JSON

    def _convert(self, input_path: Path, output_path: Path):
        # Implement conversion logic from CSV to JSON
        pass

# Usage
input_file_path = "input.csv"
output_file_path = "output.json"
input_file = ResolvedInputFile(input_file_path)
output_file = ResolvedInputFile(output_file_path)
converter = CSVToJSONConverter(input_file, output_file)
converter.convert()
```

## Exploring `openconv-python`

Building upon the `openconv-core`, the [`openconv-python`](https://github.com/Hermann-web/file-converter/tree/main/openconv-python) package offers a collection of Python scripts tailored for common file format conversions. These scripts leverage the capabilities of the framework to provide convenient solutions for handling various data transformations. Let's take a closer look:

### Extensive Conversion Support

The package includes scripts for converting between a wide range of file formats, including text, XML, JSON, CSV, and Excel. This broad support caters to diverse conversion needs across different domains.

### Integration with `openconv-core`

Utilizing classes from the `openconv-core` package for file I/O operations, MIME type detection, and exception handling ensures consistency and reliability in conversion tasks.

### Command-Line Interface

Each conversion script is equipped with a command-line interface, allowing users to specify input and output file paths, as well as input and output file types, for seamless execution of conversion tasks.

### Extensibility

The modular converter classes provided by `openconv-python` make it easy to add support for additional file formats or customize existing conversion functionalities as per project requirements.

To start using `openconv-python`, you can clone the repository and set up the environment as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hermann-web/file-converter
cd file-converter/openconv-core
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # for Unix/Linux
.\venv\Scripts\activate   # for Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To demonstrate the usage of `openconv-python`, let's consider an example of converting an XML file to JSON using the provided CLI:

```bash
openconv input.xml -t XML -o output.json -ot JSON
```

## Upcoming Enhancements

In future iterations of `openconv-python`, we plan to extend the conversion methods along with reader and writer classes. Additionally, contributions to ameliorate `openconv-core` are welcome. However, it's worth noting that the `openconv-core` repository can still be reused independently. For example, it can be utilized to create custom versions of `openconv-python` or other file conversion utilities.

## Conclusion

Efficient handling of file conversion tasks is essential in various data-centric applications. With the `openconv-core` and `openconv-python` packages, Python developers have powerful tools at their disposal to tackle such challenges effectively. Whether you're building custom conversion utilities or integrating conversion functionalities into larger projects, these packages provide a solid foundation for streamlining your workflow.

To begin leveraging the capabilities of these packages, simply install them along with their dependencies using your preferred package manager. You can then explore the provided examples and documentation to kickstart your file conversion endeavors.
