# Scanning Processes on a Linux OS for troubleshooting or simple checking

## Introduction
This markdown provides a step-by-step guide to identify and terminate processes running on a specific port, catering to both Unix-based and Windows systems.

## Handling Processes on a Port

Suppose you encounter an `OSError: [Errno 98] Address already in use` error while trying to run an application that requires port 8000. This commonly happens when another process is already using the same port.

### Method 1: Using `curl` to Test the Port
One way to check if a process is using port 8000 is by attempting to access it:

```bash
curl 127.0.0.1:8000
```

<!-- more -->

If you encounter an error or a response different from what you expect, it may indicate a running application using that port.

### Method 2: Using `ps` and `grep` Command
The `ps` command, in conjunction with `grep`, can display processes associated with a specific port. However, this method might not precisely show processes bound to port 8000; rather, it lists processes containing "8000" in their information.

```bash
ps aux | grep 8000
```

### Method 3: Using `lsof` to Identify Processes by Port
The `lsof` command is specifically designed to list processes using a particular port. Execute the following command to identify processes running on port 8000:

```bash
lsof -i :8000
```

This command displays detailed information about processes using port 8000, including their Process ID (PID) and associated program.

### Method 4: Windows Equivalent (`netstat`)
For Windows users, the `netstat` command helps identify active connections and associated processes using port 8000:

```bash
netstat -ano | findstr :8000
```

## Terminating the Identified Process

Once you've identified the Process ID (PID) of the process using port 8000, you can terminate it using the `kill` command.

1. **Identify the PID**: Use `lsof` or `netstat` to find the PID associated with port 8000.

    Example with `lsof`:

    ```bash
    lsof -i :8000
    ```

2. **Kill the Process**: Once you have the PID, use the `kill` command followed by the PID to terminate the process.

    Example, if the PID is 1234:

    ```bash
    kill 1234
    ```

Always exercise caution when terminating processes as it may impact running applications or services. Ensure proper permissions and confirm that you're terminating the correct process to avoid unintended consequences.
